          The Ibobo Walk for Life is an initiative aimed at promoting physical wellness and fostering community engagement. 
          Each year, over 700 participants—including students, professionals, and the elderly—come together for a morning of fitness. 
          The event begins with a light warm-up at the community field, followed by a 10-kilometer walk around the town, culminating back at the starting point.

          With increasingly sedentary lifestyles and a rise in lifestyle-related illnesses, 
          this initiative has played a crucial role in raising awareness about the importance of regular exercise. 
          As a result, there has been a noticeable increase in health-conscious practices, 
          including routine exercise and medical checkups among the people of Abor.

          Beyond fitness, the event incorporates health talks, free medical screenings, consultations, 
          and medication distribution as part of the Medical Mission, one of the three core pillars of the Ibobo Development Foundation. 
          This exercise reinforces the foundation’s commitment to holistic well-being.

          "A healthy community is a happy community" shared one enthusiastic participant, underscoring the positive impact of the Health Walk. 
          In addition to promoting wellness, the event strengthens social bonds, 
          providing a rare opportunity for community members—many of whom have not seen each other in months—to reconnect. 
          Over shared laughter and conversations, they enjoy a nutritious local delicacy, Okpa, accompanied by water and soft drinks. 
          More than just an exercise event, the Ibobo Walk for Life has become a tradition that unites the people of Abor in the pursuit of better health 
          and a stronger community.
